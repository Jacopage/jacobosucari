## Synopsis
The philosopher Walter Benjamin attempted to flee the Nazi advance in 1940 by crossing the border between France and Spain on foot. His escape ended in suicide. The route he took between Banyuls and Portbou has since been named the Walter Benjamin Trail, and is traveled every year by hundreds of pilgrims who come to honor his memory along with that of other exiles: those of the Republican side after Franco's coup in Spain, and those fleeing Nazi barbarism in World War II. The documentary “Walter Benjamin, the aura of the road” is the story of this route, a tale of historical memory, a reflection on exile and Benjamin's thinking.
